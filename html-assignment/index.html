            <p>
                My name is <em>Morrison MacEachern</em>, I'm a student attending Algonquin College for the <strong>second</strong> time. This time I'm going to school for <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. This is actually my 3<sup>rd</sup> time attending a post secondary institution, but I dropped out after both of my previous attempts- once at Ryerson and once at Algonquin.
            </p>
            <p>
                I live out in Kemptville, around 40 minutes outside of Ottawa. It takes some time to get to the college so I'm actually somewhat glad that it's online for my first semester. I've also found that the recorded video sessions are very useful for studying or recapping information I may have missed the first time around. All in all I'm very much looking forward to my time here, and intend to make the most of this wonderful 3<sup>rd</sup> chance at an education.
